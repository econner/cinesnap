Major features

- _Time selector_ Feature to select desired duration of video.  Probably should be in 5s chunks.

- _Speed up, slow down_ Figure out how to speed up and slow down videos when they're taken.  I don't know if this
is possible with the camera setup I have.

- _Vine-like video progress bar_ This will take some thought


- Handle landscape and portrait video modes.
