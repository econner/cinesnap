Major features

- __Time selector.__ Feature to select desired duration of video.  Probably should be in 5s chunks.

- __Speed up, slow down.__ Figure out how to speed up and slow down videos when they're taken.  I don't know if this
is possible with the camera setup I have and to what degree it will be possible.  It's likely that the maximum or 
minimum amount of time you'll be able to record will be some multiple of the length you choose.

- __Vine-like video progress bar__ This will take some thought on how to do correctly.

Details

- Handle landscape and portrait video modes.
